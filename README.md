## DepositHandler
This is the 1st MVP DApp version. This code was thoroughly tested, but it can still have security issues or not be well optimized. All found issues will be solved in the next development iterations.
### Problem we are trying to solve:
The problem with scammers in the Encode community increases quite fast, and unfortunately more and more community members receive scam messages in Discord and Email. Our group realized that the current Encode depositing mechanism(sending a Polygon address via email to do a USDC deposit) is quite an unsafe way for users.\
So our team decided to create a DepositHandler DApp, which can significantly decrease the problem of scams. We decided to minimize users interaction with external resources like email, and allow them to do a deposit on-chain through our DApp. 

### Architecture

### How does this work?
Project consists of 2 parts: smart contracts and user friendly frontend. In this repo I'll describe only how the smart contracts part works.
1. We decided to follow a factory pattern and design our system in the way that we have a factory contract which is responsible for creating bootcamp contracts. This way allow us:
 - Simplify the process of deploying multiple instances of DepositHandler(bootcamp) contract.
 - We separate bootcamp management logic from bootcamp administrative functions which are stored in the BootcampFactory contract.
2. We have 2 contracts: DepositHandler and BootcampFactory. DepositHandler contains the main logic for managing bootcamps. BootcampFactory is our factory contract which will deploy bootcamp instances. Apart from that BootcampFactory is also responsible for granting new roles for Managers and Admins, and withdrawing profit from the bootcamps.
3. Workflow:
 - Users who deployed BootcampFactory automatically assigned as an Admin in this contract.
 - Admin is the main role and this user can grant or revoke roles like `MANAGER` or `ADMIN` role from users.
 - Manager is the 2nd role and users with this role are responsible for creation of the bootcamps. Once a Manager creates a new bootcamp - he/she automatically assigned to it as a bootcamp manager.
 - Manager can create a bootcamp with all needed parameters(bootcamp start time, bootcamp deadline, deposit amount, deposit token, withdrawal duration...).
 - Once bootcamp is created, the manager will select participants based on their applications(**at the moment this is handled manually**) and they will be allowed for depositing. Users can connect their wallet, and do a deposit before bootcamp start time.
 - When bootcamp is finished, the manager will select participants who passed it(**at the moment this is handled manually**) and allow them to withdraw their deposits. Withdraw can be done during a withdrawal duration time period. Users who have not passed a bootcamp will not be able to withdraw their deposit.
4. How do we handle edge cases with deposits?
 - If a user has an exceptional situation(health problems due to which the user can't attend classes, country problems or the user just does not agree with the final decision about his/her deposit refund), then he/she can contact the manager and explain the situation. If the manager is ok with the proof from the user, then it is possible to return the deposit back to the user even if bootcamp is not yet finished, or already finished.
 - If an emergency situation appears(a bug was found or the admin set up an incorrect bootcamp time duration...), then the manager is able to do an emergency withdrawal and all users will receive their deposits back.
5. How we handle issues, bugs, hacks?
 - At the moment we added a pausable mechanism, which can pause critical functionality of the DApp in case a strange behavior appears or a bug is found.
 - Once the issue will be investigated and resolved - all critical functionality will be unpaused.

## Potential future improvements:
1. **Abstraction + Cross Chain** üåå. Support more types of deposits from more chains, providing more flexibility and possibilities for users liquidity.
2. **Monetisation** üíµ. Introduce a fee switch to bring revenue in either in form of a portion of the yield or the deposit amount.
3. **Yield option**ü§ù. Underlying assets from deposits potentially can be staked(Aave, Morpho, Ethena‚Ä¶) and yield can be split with Encode.

## Setting Up The Project

### Prerequisites 
1. Clone/Download the Repository:
```shell
git https://github.com/ohMySol/encode-deposit-handler-sc.git
```
2. Set up .env file:
Take a look in `.env.example` file. It is listed all necessary environment variables that should be set up to run a project successfully.
3. Upload .env variables to shell:
```
$ source .env
```
4. Initialize the project:
```shell
$ make all
```
This command will run the commands for cleaning, updating, building and testing the project. After this command you should see that all green tests which means that project was successfully initialized and it is ready for the future usage.

## Usage

### Build

```shell
$ forge build
```

### Test

```shell
$ forge test
```

### Format

```shell
$ forge fmt
```

### Deploy

```shell
$ make deploy CONTRACT_NAME="<your contract name>" ARGS="<network name u are deploying to>".
```

```shell
Examples:
$ make deploy CONTRACT_NAME="BootcampFactory" - this will deploy BootcampFactory to localhost
$ make deploy CONTRACT_NAME="BootcampFactory" ARGS="amoy" - this will deploy BootcampFactory to Amoy network
```
1. Check if you upload your .env variable to the shell by command `echo $ADMIN_LOCAL_PK`. After this command you should see an Admin private key from your .env in the terminal. If you don't see this, then run this command `source .env` which will upload your .env variables to the shell.
2. `CONTRACT_NAME` parameter. Here you should paste the contract which u would like to deploy. Available contracts options for deployment at the moment: `DepositTokenMock`, `DepositHandler`, `BootcampFactory`.
3. `ARGS` parameter. It stands for network name to which you would like to deploy your contract. Available networks options for deployment at the moment: `pol_fork_mainnet`, `amoy`, `no value` - means you deploying to localhost.
4. If u deploying to Tenderly or Amoy, this script will automatically verify your contract.
5. When you deploy to a local environment (like Anvil) using a Makefile or a deployment script, the Anvil process itself often runs in the background. However, when you execute a `make` command that includes `anvil &` (running Anvil in the background), it starts Anvil and then completes the make command. This can make it seem like Anvil has "stopped working" because the terminal will show that the `make` command has finished.\
But in reality:
   - Anvil is running in the background due to the `&` at the end of the command, which allows it to run asynchronously.
   - `make` command finishes after starting Anvil, and it doesn't keep an interactive session with the running process.
   
Once the deployment completes, even if the terminal shows that the make command is finished, the Anvil process is still running and **you can interact with the deployed contract**.\
To confirm that Anvil is running in the background, you can check with the following: `lsof -i :8545`.\
6. When deploying a `DepositHandler` to `pol_fork_mainnet` or `amoy` netoworks, make sure that you pasted a `depositToken` and `factory` addresses in `HelperConfig.s.sol` file in appropriate network configs.
7. When deploying to `pol_fork_mainnet` or `amoy` netoworks, make sure that you funded a deployer account with some POL.\
